# RSAPOC
<h2>Description</h2>
A simple RSA demonstration written in Nim. This repository contains programs to: generate keys, encrypt data, decrypt data, and crack (calulate the corresponding private key) public keys. It was written to see how pheasible this task would be to be implemented as a challenge problem to people with minimal experience with coding and knowledge of math. My conclusion to that question is that the number theory behind RSA is much more complex than the code required to perform it (at least with ineficient algorithms), making it more of a math course than a coding problem, but factoring a number into two prime factors (the crucial operation that makes RSA secure) could prove interesting, as the concepts are fairly simple mathematically, and there are a multitude of solutions, with varying complexity and efficieny.
